1) Objective: Verify that users can successfully log different types of workouts, such as weightlifting, cardio, or custom workouts.

Test Environment: Localhost environment to simulate the fitness app backend and frontend.

Test Data:

User with workout history: user_id_001
New user without history: user_id_002
Workout entries: weightlifting (bench press, deadlift), cardio (running, cycling)
Expected workout metrics (weight, reps, distance, time)
Test Cases:

TC 1.1: Log a new workout (bench press, 100 lbs, 8 reps). Verify that workout data is saved and accessible in the user history.
TC 1.2: Edit a previously logged workout. Update weight from 100 lbs to 110 lbs and verify the update is saved.
TC 1.3: Attempt to log a workout with invalid data (e.g., negative weight) and verify that an error message is displayed.
Expected Results:

The app saves and displays workout data accurately.
Error messages appear for invalid data.
User Acceptance Testers:





2) Testers will be users familiar with logging workouts on similar apps, such as experienced fitness enthusiasts.

Feature 2: Progress Tracking
Objective: Ensure users can view progress over time for specific exercises and track increases in weight or reps for strength-based workouts.

Test Environment: Cloud environment to simulate real-time data updates and ensure persistence across sessions.

Test Data:

User with multi-day workout history: user_id_001
Exercises tracked: Squat, Bench Press
Historical data showing incremental increases in weight and reps over 4 weeks
Test Cases:

TC 2.1: Verify that after logging 3 workouts, your workout history is shown
TC 2.2: Ensure monthly progress summary reflects increases in weight and reps accurately.
TC 2.3: Attempt to view progress for an exercise not yet logged and verify that a message indicates "No data available."
Expected Results:

Progress data is displayed accurately, reflecting the user’s workout history.
Users receive clear feedback when no data exists for a specific exercise.
User Acceptance Testers:

Testers include frequent gym users and those who track progress, as they can validate realistic weight progression.




Feature 3: Social Feature - Friends’ Progress and Congratulatory Comments
Objective: Validate that users can view friends’ progress on specific exercises and post congratulatory comments.

Test Environment: Cloud environment to test real-time social interactions and data synchronization between users.

Test Data:

User: user_id_001 with friends user_id_002 and user_id_003
Friends’ workout history showing recent personal bests
Comment data (text field for congratulatory messages)
Test Cases:

TC 3.1: User views friends’ progress (e.g., user_id_002 achieving a new bench press max). Verify that progress details are visible.
TC 3.2: User posts a congratulatory message for a friend’s new max. Verify that the comment appears on the friend’s feed.
TC 3.3: User tries to post a comment without text and verify that an error message prompts them to enter a message.
Expected Results:

Friends’ progress displays correctly.
Comments are posted successfully, and validation is enforced for empty comments.
User Acceptance Testers:

Social feature testers, ideally users who engage in fitness communities and track each other’s progress.
